# Signal Processing Project

## Purpose
This project demonstrates signal processing techniques on audio data, including filtering and noise reduction.

## Method
- **Low-Pass Filtering**: Applied to remove high-frequency noise.
- **Noise Reduction**: Enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio.

## Results
- Processed audio files are located in the `/results` directory.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project using `g++ -o main main.cpp signal_processing.cpp`.
3. Run the executable with `./main`.

## Dependencies
- Aquila DSP library
