# Description

This project applies basic signal processing techniques to audio files. The main techniques implemented are:

- **Low-Pass Filtering**: Removes high-frequency noise from the signal.
- **Noise Reduction**: Improves the quality of the audio signal.

## Data
The audio files used for processing are stored in the `/data` directory.

## Results
The processed audio files are saved in the `/results` directory, demonstrating the effects of the applied filters.
